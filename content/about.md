I'm Dan Herbert, a software developer in the San Francisco Bay Area. This blog is for my silly ramblings, technical stuff I find interesting, cooking recipies, and any other miscellaneous longer-form stuff I feel like sharing that doesn't fit into a tweet. This blog has an RSS feed if you want to subscribe.
