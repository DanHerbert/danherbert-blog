I'm Dan Herbert, a software developer in the San Francisco Bay Area. This blog is for my silly ramblings, technical stuff I find interesting, cooking recipies, and any other miscellaneous longer-form stuff I feel like sharing that doesn't fit into a tweet. This blog has an [RSS feed](/blog/index.xml) if you want to subscribe.

## Technical Things About This Site
This entire blog is generated using the [Hugo static site generation framework](https://gohugo.io/). It uses the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) for most of the layout with a few small custom bits I wrote myself based on personal preferences. The whole site is publicly hosted on Github for those interested in seeing how it works. It is hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) through an [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) server I manage myself.
