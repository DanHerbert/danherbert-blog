**Prep time:** 30 minutes
&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Cook time:** 25-30 minutes
&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Total:** 1 hour

## Ingredients

**For the Cake:**
*  1½c (180g) All-purpose flour
*  2tsp Baking Powder
*  ½tsp Salt
*  ½c (60g) Pistachios (shelled)
*  1c (50g) Spinach
*  ½tsp Vanilla extract
*  1tsp Almond extract
*  ¼c Unrefined coconut oil, melted
*  ½c Coconut sugar
*  1tsp Rose water (optional, add 1tsp plain water if omitted)
*  ½c Unsweetened almond milk (see notes)
*  1tbsp Apple cider vinegar

**For the topping**
*  1c (113g) Powdered sugar
*  1-2 tbsp Unsweetened almond milk (see notes)
*  1tsp Almond extract
*  ¼c (30g) Chopped pistachios

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F
1. Combine unsweetened almond milk and apple cider vinegar and whisk vigorously. Allow it to curdle, about 5-10 minutes.
1. Whisk the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt) in a large bowl and set aside.
1. Using a food processor or blender, grind the pistachios into a powder. Add the coconut oil, coconut sugar, vanilla extract, almond extract, and rose water, and blend for 10 seconds. Add spinach and coconut sugar, then blend until smooth.
1. Add the curdled almond milk, plus the spinach mixture, to the dry ingredients and gently fold until just combined. Do not overstir. It will have a thick, almost bread-dough-like texture.
1. Spread evenly into a loaf pan 9” x 5” loaf pan greased with coconut oil and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
1. Remove from oven, then allow to cool in pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and allow to cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
1. Create the glaze topping by combining the powdered sugar, almond milk, and almond extract. Start with just 1 tbsp of almond milk and add 1 tsp at a time more for the desired consistency. It is supposed to have a very thick consistency so add more liquid sparingly.
1. **\[Optional\]** Toast the chopped pistachios for a few minutes in an oven or toaster oven to dry them out more. They will absorb moisture from the cake & glaze so toasting keeps them feeling crunchy for longer.
1. After the loaf has finished cooling, top with glaze and the chopped pistachios.

## Notes

*  If available in your grocery store, substitute unsweetened almond milk with unsweetened pistachio milk. The almond milk/extract really only contributes to the “nutty” flavor in this recipe and doesn’t really make it taste like almonds thanks to all of the real pistachios already in the recipe, but using pistachio milk will give it a little bit more pistachio kick.
*  This recipe was adapted from [One Green Planet](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-recipe/pistachio-cake). The recipe had numerous mistakes and omissions from the ingredients list. Trying to complete it as-written on that link ended up as an awful mess. I experimented on my own with adding/removing ingredients until I found a flavor & texture that felt right, which is what you’ll find above.
*  I would like to thank the original author of the recipe, Gabrielle St. Claire (presently [eatdrinkshrink.com](https://eatdrinkshrink.com)) since after a few corrections were made it came out perfect. Because the recipe is several years old (2016) and on a site that I assume Gabrielle does not write for any longer, I have not attempted to reach out to the original author to correct the source.
